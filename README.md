# Aerodynamic Performance of NASA LS Airfoils for Fixed-Wing UAV Applications in the Martian Atmosphere

## Overview

This repository contains the datasets, airfoil geometries, simulation files, and supplementary material used in the research paper:

> **Aerodynamic Performance of NASA LS Airfoils for Fixed-Wing UAV Applications in the Martian Atmosphere**

The study investigates the influence of **airfoil thickness ratio** on the aerodynamic efficiency of NASA Low-Speed (LS) airfoils operating under Martian atmospheric conditions. Computational analysis was performed using both **XFLR5** and **CFD simulations in SimScale**.

## Research Question

> **How does the airfoil thickness ratio of a NASA LS airfoil affect its aerodynamic efficiency (lift-to-drag ratio) in Martian atmospheric conditions for a slow-speed fixed-wing UAV under varying angles of attack?**
